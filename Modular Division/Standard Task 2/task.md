# Standard Task 2
Ask the user to enter a whole number and store it into the variable named `number`. Tell the user if their number is odd or even.

<div class="hint">
  This task isn't about knowing how to use an <code>if</code> statement. I have provided the basic structure of an if statement you should use, but you need to provide the correct modular division statement inside the <code>()</code> of the <code>if</code> statement.. Remember, we use <code>==</code> to check if one number is equal to another.
